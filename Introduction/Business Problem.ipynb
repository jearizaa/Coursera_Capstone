Between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability as a result of ther injury. \n\nRoad traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, their families, and to nations as a whole. These losses arise from the cost of treatment as well as lost productivity for those killed or disabled by their injuries, and for family members who need to take time off work or school to care for the injured. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product.\n\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/road-traffic-injuries"
